      <h2>City Cycling Routes</h2>
      <p>For those looking for a more local experience in the cities around the
         island, Taiwan is a cyclist's paradise. Each city boasts fabulous and
         unique cycling adventures for riders of any endurance level, from placid
         farm lanes to the (in)famous King of the Mountain climb. Click on a city
         for local maps and recommendations.</p>

        <p>Despite being the beating heart of the island, Taipei offers broad
           streets, sinuous riverside trails, and mountains escapes. Taipei's
           Youbike public bicycle system is excellent and well-serviced, but the
           3-speed transmissions are ill-suited for trips outside the city's flat
           core. Luckily, the popular cycling destinations are flanked by inexpensive
           rental shops for those who need it. Public transport in Taipei is rivaled
            only by Japan, with an ever-growing metro system that can carry you to
            the farthest corners.</p>
        <p>Taipei City's <a href="https://travel.taipei/">travel.taipei</a> site is the
          best jumping-off point for any adventures in the city. The
          <a href="https://www.travel.taipei/Content/images/static/information/taipei_cycling-map1_en.pdf">Taipei City Cycling Map(EN)</a>
          is an excellent resource to start with.</p>

        <p>Less touristy and with an underdeveloped public transit network, Taichung
           is the city of long-term expats and families.  However, the city still
           boasts some excellent cycling.  The highlight of the city is the

           Hou-Feng bike path</a>, passing over a broad river and under a mountain
           by way of an old rail line and train tunnel. The

        <p>Tainan is a city rich in history. Inhabited by aboriginal peoples for
           30,000 years, in the 16th century the city became a hub for Chinese
           and Japanese traders and fisherman. The Dutch East India Company
           established a colony in the city in the 1600's, only to be ousted by
           Ming-dynasty loyalist Koxinga in 1661. After 200 years under the Qing
           empire, the entire island fell into Jpanese hands, only returning to
           (Nationalist) Chinese rule after World War II. Each successive wave
           has remade aspects of the city in it's image, resulting in the "Phoenix
            City" of modern-day Tainan.</p>
        <p>The history and architechture of the old city is beautiful and engaging,
           while the shorline and farmland surrounding the city offers a peaceful
            respite. The
            <a href="https://tbike.tainan.gov.tw/Portal/en-US/Tour/RouteList">Tainan T-bike</a>
            website attempts to offer English-language service, but has technical issues.
            Instead, take a train and
            <a href="https://www.twtainan.net/en/statics/abouttainan">make your own adventure</a>
            through the historic city.  The core of the old city is quite flat
            and compact, and easy to enjoy by bicycle.</p>

        <p>Kaohsiung is the southern anchor of the island. Representing a laid-back
           alternative to the captial, the city is nestled between warm beaches
           and towering mountains. Once an industrial wasteland, Kaohsiung has
           been reborn in recent decades, with wide cycling paths throughout the
           city and stellar public transport second only to Taipei. The miles of
           beach-side cycling path along Cijin Island are of particular beauty,
           threading through palm trees and sand next to the glistening sea.
           Nearby Pier 2 Art Center is an opportunity to shop and take in the
           growing art scene in the city. The
           <a href="https://pwbgis.kcg.gov.tw/bicycle/">Kaohsiung City Government</a>
           website is unfortunately Chinese-only, and will require Google Translate
           for most to peruse.</p>

        <p>The east coast is more rugged and natural, too abused by frequent
          typhoons for large urban development, and historically inconvenient to
          access. Full of natural beauty, the mountains and plains offer breathtaking
          cycling in more ways than one. The route between Hualien and Taitung is
          very popular, with the Giant shops in each city partnering to offer
          one-way touring bike rentals to enjoy the coast line.</p>
        <p>For the sadists, Hualien's awe-inspiring Taroko Gorge is home to the annual
          <a href="http://www.taiwankom.org/en/">King of the Mountain Challenge</a>.
          A 65-mile long ride, climbing 2 miles from sea-level to the top of
          Taiwan's towering central mountain range, this route is not for the
          faint of spirit. For those with a need for speed (or bad knees), the
          route can be done in reverse with nearly zero pedalling, but bring brake
          pads and beware the tunnels and sheer cliffs!</p>
